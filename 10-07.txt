***Exception hirarchy->
-----------------------
   -Throwable class acts as a root for java exceptions hirarchy.Throwable class 
    defines two child classes.
   1)Exception
   2)Error 
   
   1)Exception-
   -----------
      MOst of the time exception are coused by our program and these are recoverable.
	  ex.
	    if our pgm  a requirement is to read data from remote is to read data 
		from London file at runtime if London file is not available then we will
		get runtime exception saying FileNotFoundException.
		    If FileNotFoundException occures we can provide local file and 
	 continue rest of the program normally.
	 ex.
	   try{
	   read data from remote file 
	   locating at london
	   }
	   catch(FileNotFoundException e){
	   use local file and continue
	   rest of program normally
	   }
	   
	   2)Error-
	   --------
	   MOst of the time errors are not coused by our program and these
	   are due to lack of system resources.Error are non recoverable.
	   for ex. 
	       If outofMemory error occurs being a programmer we cannt do anything and
	program will be terminate abnormally. System admin or server admin 
	is responsible to increase heap memory.
