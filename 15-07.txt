##Throw keyword-
----------------
  -Sometimes we can create exception  object explicitly and we can handover to the 
	jvm manually for this we have to use throw keyword.
	
	ex.
	  throw new AE : "/by zero"
	  
	-Hence the main objective of throw keyword is to handover our created exception
	object to the jvm manually.
	
	
	ex.
	class Test{
	psvm(s[]a){
	syout(10/0); //Arithmatic Exception
	}
	}
	//in this case main() method is responsible to create an exception object
	and handover to the jvm
	
	
	2)
	class Test1{
	psvm(s[]a){
	throw new AE("/by zero");
	}
	}
	//in this  case programmer is responsible for to create an exception object
	and handover to the jvm.
	
	
	Note: Best use of throw keyword is for user defined exception or custumized 
	exception.
