3)Encapsulation->
-----------------
    The process of binding data and corresponding method into a single unit 
is nothing but encapsulation.	

ex. every java class is the example of encapsulation.

The main advantage of encapsulation are-
----------------------------------------
1) We can achiev secuirity.
2) Enhancment will become easy.
3) It improves maintainability of the application.
      The  main advantage of encapsulation is we can achieve secuirity but the
the main disadvantage of encapsulation is it increase length of the code 
and slow down execution.

***Which of the following classes are tightly encapsulated?
-----------------------------------------------------------

class A {
private int x = 10;
}

class B extends A{
int y=20;
}

class C extends A {
private int z = 30;
}
	
***Which of the following classes are tightly encapsulated?
-----------------------------------------------------------

class Parent{
 int x = 10;
}

class Child extends Parent{
private int y = 30;
}

class Chil1 extends Parent{
private int z = 40;
}

Note-
-----
    If the parent class is not tightly encapsulated then no child class is tightly 
encapsulated.



4)Inheritance->
---------------
    Inheritance means one class can extends to another class. So that the code can 
be reused from one class to another  class.
 
 -The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability.
 -By using extends keywords we can implement inheritance concept.
 
ex.
  Class Animal {
  public void eat(){
  sopln("I m eating");
  }
  }
  
  class Dog extends Animal{
  psvm(s[]args){
  Dog dog = new Dog();
  dog.eat();
  }  
  }
