 
##Case 2: Difference between t.start() and t.run() methods.
------------------------------------------------------------
-In the case of t.start() a new Thread will be created which is responsible for the
execution of run() method. But in the case of t.run() no new Thread will be 
created and run() method will be executed just like a normal method by the main 
Thread.

##Case 3: importance of Thread class start() method.
----------------------------------------------------
-For every Thread the required/mandatory activities
 like registering the Thread with 
 Thread Scheduler will takes
 care by Thread class start() method and 
 programmer is responsible just to define the job of the Thread inside run() method.
 That is start() method acts as best assistant to the programmer.
Example:
start()
{
1. Register Thread with Thread Scheduler
2. All other mandatory low level activities.
3. Invoke or calling run() method.
}
-We can conclude that without executing Thread class start() method there is no chance
of starting a new Thread in java


##Case 4: If we are not overriding run() method-
------------------------------------------------
- If we are not overriding run() method 
then Thread class run() method will be executed
which has empty implementation and hence we won’t get any output.
Example:
class MyThread extends Thread
{}
class ThreadDemo
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
MyThread t=new MyThread();
t.start();
}
}
-It is highly recommended to override run() method.
 Otherwise don’t go for multithreading concept.


###Case 5: Overload of run() method-
--------------------------------------

-We can overload run() method but 
Thread class start() method always invokes no
argument run() method 
the other overload run() methods we have to call explicitly then
only it will be executed just like normal method.
Example:
package MultiThreading;

class MyThread extends Thread
{
public void run()
{
System.out.println("no arg method");
}
public void run(int i)
{
System.out.println("int arg method");
}
}
class ThreadDemo
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
MyThread t=new MyThread();
t.start();
t.run(10);
}
}
Output:
int arg method
no arg method
