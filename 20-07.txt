###Customized Exceptions (User defined Exceptions):
   -Sometimes we can create our own exception to meet our programming requirements.
    Such type of exceptions are called customized exceptions (user defined exceptions).
  Ex.
    1) InSufficientFundsException
    2) TooYoungException
    3) TooOldException
	
	ex.
class TooYoungException extends RuntimeException
{
TooYoungException(String s)
{
super(s);
}
}

class TooOldException extends RuntimeException
{
TooOldException(String s)
{
super(s);
}
}


class CustException
{
public static void main(String[] args){
int age=Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
if(age>60)
{
throw new TooOldException("u r age already crossed....no chance of getting married");

}
else if(age<18)
{

throw new TooYoungException("please wait some more time.... u will get best match");
}
else
{
System.out.println("you will get match details soon by e-mail");
}}}

Note: It is highly recommended to maintain our customized exceptions as unchecked by
extending RuntimeException.
