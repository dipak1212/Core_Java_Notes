1]Switch Statement->
=====================
-The Java switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions.
-If Serveral options are available then it is not recomended 
   to go for nested if else.Beacouse it reduced redibility.
   To handle this REquirement we should go for switch statement.
-The Java switch expression must be of byte, short, int, long , enums and string.
-Each case statement can have a break statement which is optional. 
   When control reaches to the break statement, 
   it jumps the control after the switch expression. 
   If a break statement is not found, it executes the next case.
-The case value can have a default label which is optional.
ex.
package core_java;

public class SwitchExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int month = 2;
		String monthString = "";
		switch (month) {

		case 1:
			monthString = "1- january";
			break;

		case 4:
			monthString = "4- Feb";
			break;
		case 3:
			monthString = "3- March";
			break;
		default:
			System.out.println("invalid month..!");

		}
		System.out.println(monthString);

	}

}


2] while loop->
=============
-If We  dont know number of iterations in advanced,then we should go for while loop.
-The  while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times.
-If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop.
 
 Syntax:
while(condition){  
//code to be executed  
} 

ex.
public class WhileLoopExample {
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		
		int i = 0;
		while(i<=10) {
			System.out.println(i);
			i++;
		}
	}

}  

3]do while->
==========
-The java do-while loop is used when  we want execute loop body at least once,Even
  condition is false.

-The Java do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked
 after loop body.

Syntax:
do{  
//code to be executed  
}while(condition);

ex.1)
public class DoWhileExample {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    int i=1;  
    do{  
        System.out.println(i);  
    i++;  
    }while(i<=10);  
}  
}    


ex.2)
public class DoWhileExample2 {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    do{  
        System.out.println("infinitive do while loop");  
    }while(true);  
}  
}
