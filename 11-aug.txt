				##Collections
				--------------
-An array is an indexed collection of fixed no of homogenous(same data type)
 data element.
-The main advantage of array is we can represent multiple values by using
 sigle variable. so that redability of the code will be improved.
for ex.
     class Testarray1{
public static void main(String args[]){

int a[]={33,3,4,5};

//printing array
for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
System.out.println(a[i]);

}}

#Limitations  of an array-
--------------------------
-Array are fixed in sized. i.e. once we creates an array there is no chance to 
 increasing or decreasing the size based on our requirement.
-Due to this to use array concept compulsury we should know the  size of array in  
advanced, which is not possible always.
-Array can hold only homogenous data dype elements.

-Overcome this limitations we should go for collection concept.

1)collection can growable in nature. That is based on our requirement we can
 increase or decrease the size.
2)Collection can hold both homogenous and heterogenous data types.
3)Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure.Hence
  for ervery requirement readymade method support is available.
